# Laboratory 1 Azure-AI900

Repository devoted to store the resources developed during the DIO's Azure AI900 Bootcamp.

This readme file contains a brief description of the steps involved in seting up, running and evaluating an automatic ML task in the Azure AI | Machine Learning Studio.

## Step 1 - Create Azure Account
The first step is to create a free Azure account so that to be able to test the resources available in the Machine Learning Studio.


## Step 2 - Accessing the Machine Learning Studio and deploying the workspace
The second Step involves accessing the Machine Learning Studio environment and getting to know some of its features.
Some of them, include:
* Marketplace;
* Resource creation

We can also get familiar with concepts such as:
* Resource groups;
* Workspaces

With that in mind, we can finally configure and deploy our workspace, to be used for developing the laboratory.

## Step 3 - Data sources, models and training configuration

The next step includes:
* configuring our data sources (used to train our machine learning models)
* defining the machine learning models to be trained
* defining the training parameters, such as our evaluation metrics and thresholds for early stopping, training time limits and so on;
* defining the environment configuration (whether to use CPU or GPU, the virtual machine settings, number of instances, and so on)

## Step 4 - Model evaluation, deployment and testing

Once the models are trained, we are now able to evaluate the best model's performance on the test set.
Even more than that! Given that we validate that the model has actually learned, we can deploy it to an endpoint and test with new data!!!

The json files used for testing and storing the results, respectively, are available along with this readme file.
